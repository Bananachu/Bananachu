**Hello everyone!**

My name is Bananachu, I'm French and I love programming. I started with HTML/CSS (not programming languages I know meh) when writing articles on Poképédia, the french equivalent for Bulbapedia. Then I started JavaScript to make a Discord bot (Bananabot, not very active :/) and now I'm learning C. In the future I would learn C++, Java and Rust in order to become a game devlopper.

I don't know what I can write here, so there is my setup (old but gold) :
* PC : Asus X72Jr 
    * CPU : i3 M 370 @ 2.3GHz
    * GPU : ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470
    * RAM : 6Gb DDR3
    * SSD : 120Gb
* OS : GNU/Linux Debian 10 (buster)
* WM : i3-gaps w/ Polybar and Rofi
* IDE : Sublime Text most of the time and Vim for fast edits
* Terminal : URXVT
* Navigator : Firefox

My config files for i3, Polybar and Rofi are available in this repo.
