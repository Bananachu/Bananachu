**Hello everyone!**

My name is Bananachu, I'm French and I love computers, Linux, programming, video games and others nerds things.

----

I don't know what I can write here, so here's my config (which is my sister's old laptop except I added an SSD and some RAM) :
* PC : Asus X72Jr
    * CPU : i3 M 370 @ 2.4GHz
    * GPU : ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470
    * RAM : 6Gb DDR3
    * SSD : 120Gb
* OS : GNU/Linux Debian 11 (bullseye)
* WM : i3-gaps w/ Polybar and Rofi
* IDE : Sublime Text most of the time and Vim for fast edits
* Terminal : URXVT
* Navigator : Firefox

If you want to see what it looks like, I did a post on r/unixporn :

My config files for i3, Polybar and Rofi are available in this repo (called Bananachu by default).
